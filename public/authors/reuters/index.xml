      <description>&lt;p&gt;ADDIS ABABA — Ethiopia&amp;rsquo;s upper house speaker resigned on Monday in apparent protest at the postponement of planned elections in the Horn of Africa country over the coronavirus, a sign of growing tension between her party and the government.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The speaker Keria Ibrahim is also a top official in Tigray People&amp;rsquo;s Liberation Front (TPLF), one of the country&amp;rsquo;s major political parties and which has opposed the poll postponement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The parliamentary and regional elections had been planned for August ahead of the end of incumbent Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed&amp;rsquo;s term in September. No new date has yet been set.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a televised speech, Keria accused Abiy&amp;rsquo;s government of taking away Ethiopians&amp;rsquo; sovereign rights, without elaborating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She was widely understood to refer to the government&amp;rsquo;s decision to postpone the elections which effectively allowed Abiy to continue ruling beyond the expiry of his term.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I can&amp;rsquo;t be an accomplice when the constitution is being violated and a dictatorial government is being formed,&amp;rdquo; she said. &amp;ldquo;I have resigned not to be collaborator (with) such a historical mistake.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
