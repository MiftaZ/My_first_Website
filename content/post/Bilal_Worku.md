The current situation in Ethiopia is worse than before. The Nobel
peace prize Abiy Ahmed couldn’t make peace within the country, after he came to power
dozens of people were killed, large number of people are internally displaced because of their
identity. Experienced and influential journalists left the country and applied for asylum in
Australia and England due to harassment and prosecution they got from the government
officials for doing their jobs.

Bilal Worku, a senior journalist with Ethiopia’s state broadcaster(EBC) was on the team that accompanied deputy Prime Minister Demeke Mekonnen to the UK-Africa summit which took place in London. But He failed to return home as scheduled and subsequently sought asylum saying he had been threatened by high-ranking government officials
